I wasnâ€™t supposed to {Verb1} the glimmering {Noun4} as they hung, \n

brush them with my {Noun6} anyway. It was addictive to paint the \n

lights and watch them sway, imagining my mother on the dance floor, \n
conjuring images of date nights when Mama walked out of the house \n
with a black cocktail dress and her best pearls along with the smokey \n
scent of her expensive perfume.'''
