# 01_Madlibs
This is my first project based on python and I decided to make this repository to keep a track of my progress on GiHhub.
This is a project based on a YouTube video by Kylie Ying with the purpose of creating a program which by definition is a word game where one player prompts another for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story.
Hopefully this will be one among a string of really long list of upcoming projects that I plan to write down.
